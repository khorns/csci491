        <h2>Create your first video game</h2>
        <p>Video game has become a great innovation concept of human interaction with machine began from the past several decades. As computer technology improves over the course of history, newer and better computer hardwares are built which are bringing further more powerful and improvement of computation in computer graphic. The term “computer” is no longer just referring to the traditional desktop computer; but it also serves for all devices that we most familiar with such as smartphone, tablet, laptop, and etc. Without any further ado , let's talk about requirements and tips to create your first video game and tools that many professional developers are using in the gaming industry.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Why making a game?</h3>
        <p>Most people would agree that creating a video game is a fun and exciting experience. This is true for a lot people; and it is also a long and painful project for many people who first dips their toe into game development or even the professional. By the end of the day, regardless of whatever type of game you create will be something you can be proud to show of because the game you create would visually represent your effort and what you have achieved. This provide a self-satisfaction experience as well as the motivation to refine and extend the game bigger and potentially becoming more complex</p>
        
        <h3>What are to expect?</h3>
        <p>Usually for a beginner, setting up too high of a project scope is a well known issue for the new developer. The excitement for building a large game from the start aren’t usually work out; moveover, it might end up discouraging the continuation of the project since the project will never catch up to the plan. For example, Devin is only recently get into game development. He has some really cool idea of how his game is going to be; for instance, and open world platform game with jumping and shooting mechanics. The possibility is endless as Devin envisions his first game to be, but the practical aspect of putting together the idea is probably unrealistic. The problem is the scope of the project. There will be problems as you are developing your game and tackle on the solution for those problems will prove to be challenging. As a matter of fact, try to build your game simple as you start, then continue building upon it and ensured all the core mechanics of your game are functioned as you intended before throwing in the fancy stuffs.</p>
        
        <h3>Define your game</h3>
        <p>You can begin by answering questions of what type of game you want to create. Would it be a top-down platform, side-scrolling, orthogonal? Once define that, you can write a little background story about your game and characters. This does not have to be long but a paragraph should be sufficient. The idea is to construct a rough plan of your game as well as to imagine the game mechanics that you may want to include. On the other hand while working in a group environment, this phase would also include a group discussion session where everyone in the group would brainstorm and pitch their idea. At this point, you should have a good idea of your project and ready to jump into creating your game.</p>
