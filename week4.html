        <h2>Enemy</h2>
        <p>We have seen and have played different type of video game. It may be a strategy game, a puzzle game, or an adventure game, and the list is go on and on. Although all genres are varied differently, one component that is inherited by all video game is “enemy”. The term “enemy” is a bit ambiguous in this context. When we say “enemy”, it is interpreted as all entities that may or may not cause conflict to a player as a game progresses. For instance an enemy could be an AI humanoid creature that attacks a player, or block pieces resemble to the traditional Mario game. Another similar terminology to this is “obstacle”. What make a video game interesting are the conflicts that those enemies could bring to the player in which cause the player to overcome any challenges in an intelligent method. As a matter of fact, we will be looking at some great concepts that help us craft enemies that are memorable to the player.</p>
        
        <p>What set video game apart from other forms of entertainment such as film or television shows is player has the control to be the actor themselves. They are not a passive viewer or a bystander, instead they have the opportunity to be part of the activities they want to experience. With that being said, video game is a virtual space that is possible to simulate the experience; and it is up to the game developer to come up with a fresh and engaging contents.</p>
        
        <p>Choosing an art style for your game is critical. Designing all enemies that fit well into an environment setting is essentially the main goal you want to achieve if you want to further enrich the gameplay experience. A keyword for this section is “appearance”. For example, you want to design an NPC enemy that roams around a desert setting. It would make sense if your design is closely resemble to creatures such as camel, or lizard. This may be a generic solution since those creatures are in fact known to inhabit in the desert setting; and polar bears aren’t. The idea is to keep things relevant to what the reality is liked as best as you can. Appearance and behavior of your the enemy character provides an impression of your game and also what make your game uniquely distinguishable from other.</p>
        
        <p>Besides creating an enemy base on appearance alone, smarter AI should be a good topic to cover. Imagine you are playing a video game that is really linear throughout the entire gameplay. The fun component of the game is dramatically dropped and there won’t be much expectation from the game. If it is a combat type game which the player gets to slash or smash stuffs, it is better to give the AI enemies more options to either attack or defend. With little randomize patterns could create an interesting effect that may exponentially improve the overall quality of your game.</p>
        
        <p>Designing an enemy is an art. Sometime the game developer should think about the range of difficulty the players should anticipate and what may invoke fear into them to overcome the hardship. Ultimately we want players to put up a considerable fight and defeating the enemy would serve a proof to their achievement.</p>
