        <h2>Game Engine</h2>
        <p>Being a computer science student, it is unlikely that you didn’t come across a project which you had to develop a game. Take the object oriented programming class as the example. A game could be as simple as a text base that run on terminal or cmd that only require your typing skill to make various decisions. Toward the end of the quarter, you realized the final assignment requirements is to implement your game graphically and you know how hard it is to do so from using Java. Your choice could either be using Swing or Processing and it was a total disaster for many groups that had little or no experience using those APIs. The good news is there are better alternative methods to design and develop an awesome game that can run on almost all sort of gaming platforms.</p>
        
        <p>It is might be a little late to ask what a game engine is. According to our extremely trusted source, Wikipedia, “a game engine is a software framework designed for the creation and development of video games.” This is crystal clear to us that a game engine is designed to help accommodate and to ease the workflow of game development. Many popular game engines even allow non-programmer to build a fantastic game with stunning graphic. Typically the drag and drop feature is playing a significant role which is a key feature among many features that define how powerful the software could be.</p>
        
        
        <h3>2D or 3D</h3>
        <p>Which one is your favorite? 3D game is awesome. It provides a depth of field, perspective, and more. What about the traditional 2D game we have been playing and love? Simplicity? May be is not so much. Technology allow game developer to create a much better and richer 3D gaming experience we ever seen and this is going to get even better in the upcoming future. Virtual Reality is hitting the market and we are going to see this new big thing is leading us in gaming. The question is remained whether the 2D game will ever be disappeared. The answer is “yes” for only under the circumstance that no one is playing a 2D game anymore. However, it is unlikely to happen and we are all know about it. 2D game is not going to go anywhere because it is the root of video game. With that being said, new technology is also improve the quality of 2D game; and we are excited to see its future.</p>
        
        <h3>Get an Engine</h3>
        <p>Understanding what type of game you are going to make is crucial when it comes down to choosing a game engine that is set to be your developing environment. Some of the popular engine I would recommend to start with are:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Unity (C# / JavaScript)</li>
            <li>Game Maker Studio (Game Maker Language)</li>
            <li>Unreal Engine 4 (C++)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I will not go in dept of pros and cons of these engine, except these engines are the most popular engines that are available for free or license; and they have a really good community support. If you want to create a 3D game project, it is better to use Unity or Unreal Engine 4, while Game Maker is more suited for building a 2D platform game with no scripting feature.</p>
