        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>You have come a long way to finally arrive here on this page. If you happen to miss out all the previous blogs, which I am sure most of you are, then this is the perfect place to summary everything up. I have been writing about creating a video game ever since the beginning of the quarter. The reason I sat down and collected my thought to write such a topic is because I have a huge interest in game design as a developer and a player myself. While I am holding the title of a novice game developer, there were many new ideas and concepts I acquired over the course of my research on this particular topic. Little piece by piece as I continued to build up my knowledge around the subject matter, I realized creating a video game is surprisingly difficult. It is not only hard to create a fun and simple game from the technical point of view but it is also even harder to make it interesting to the players. With all my effort from the very beginning of writing this blog series, here is my final conclusion I have drawn.</p>
        
        <p>Making a video game is fun but the processes aren’t necessary so. It is important that you want to initiate strong with consistent idea and plan before jump right into a project. If you are willing to spend sometimes studying all the necessary tools that potentially valuable to your workflow, then you will appreciate of how much trouble you could avoid later. Once you have a good picture of how the game be liked, essentially you want to decide on what type of work environment you want to work with. There are many popular game engines that are available to choose such as <i>Unity3d</i>, <i>Unreal</i> and so on. One of which has advantages over the other that would suit your need better.</p>
        
        <p>With all the basic setup complete, it is time to dive into creating your video game. A good game designer spend a good amount of time researching and crafting characters as well as the game mechanics. Character design is every important.  A well thought character design is not only containing visual appearance, but it is also look at many other details that can bring the character to life. We have talked about the a few elements to help surface an interesting and memorable character to players by using characteristic, style, and background story. Finally, what type of discovery mechanic which feature the sort of game you create. There are a few discoveries that was mentioned previously such as geographic discovery, content discovery, and other. This concept help envision your project’s scale and other requirements that you may otherwise miss out.</p>
        
        <p>Everybody has different opinion on how they start working on a project. Because of it, this blog series is meant to introduce a foundation of game development. There is no one cookie cutter to decide if doing the right thing with your game.</p>
