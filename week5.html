        <h2>Discovery</h2>
        <p>It is an exciting moment when you and your team decide to start a new game project. The brainstorming session begin and everyone has something to put on the table for critique. One of the most important part before starting a project is the project idea exploration. You want to define the scope of your project and the feasible features that you and your team can accomplish within the duration of the development. As a matter of fact, today, we will be looking at three discoveries concepts that many popular video games have embed; and we, as the player, are enjoy playing for decades.</p>
        
        <h3>Geographic Discovery</h3>
        <p>If you are the person who enjoy exploring a game world such as landscape and environment, you are falling into the geographic discovery. Geographic discovery main focus is the inspiration of geographic exploration that offers players not only the gameplay experience, but also invokes the urge of exploring the beauty of the game’s world itself. A few examples include <b>Perfect World International</b>, <b>Black Desert Online</b>, and <b>Xenoblade Chronicles X</b>. The open world aspect of the game offer a great opportunity for the titles to expanse many flavors of adventuring. While it seems to be a good concept to create such a game, it has huge disadvantages toward the development process. All of which associate to the creation of the vast world that enrich with ecosystems that incurs a higher cost of the productions and time.</p>
        
        <h3>Mechanical Discovery</h3>
        <p>Discover a new element in a game that enrich a gameplay experience is the concept of Mechanical Discovery. A better definition to it is a game mechanic. What make it interesting is the curiosity to better understanding a game mechanic that engage player to dig deeper into figuring out all the wondrous way of its interaction. For instance, the skill tree system, and the leveling system. As player making progress, leveling up, they are granted access to some new skills or a set of interaction they didn’t have before. We see mechanical discovery being implemented in almost all games, especially MMORPG genres. The discovery is the most cost effective in comparison to other although it is the most difficult to implement from the developer perspective.</p>
        
        <h3>Content Discovery</h3>
        <p>Content discovery has a very similar approach to geographic discovery; however, it’s focus is completely different. It is all about finding new stuff in the game. If you are a Pokémon player, the chance is, you know you gotta catch them all. Content discovery provide a sense of excitement as player get to discover and acquire various items as the game progress. Another example is the trading card game such as <b>HeartStone</b>, and <b>Magic The Gathering</b>. As a player, it is always exciting to find out the new contents, the new card pack in the set, and especially the stuff you can claim the ownership after a content update roll-out. The cost of a game that inherited the content discovery is vary greatly from game to game; and with a well design thinking, it usually turns out to be cheaper than geographic discovery.</p>
        
        <p>There are many more discoveries that are missing out from the list. Understanding these discoveries may provide you some idea of the sort of game you will create in the future project as well as weighing the pros and cons of the direction you should take to successfully develop your finish product.</p>
