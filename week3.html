        <h2>Character</h2>
        
        <p>A video game which attract player to invest their time and emotion often involve character design that bridge a connection between the player and the character. We have seen many success, just to name a few, from Mario that made his appearance since 1981, Link from the Legend of Zelda, to Lara Croft in Tomb Raider. These characters are the most recognizable by the gamer communities as well as the most iconic characters we would never forget. Interesting enough, character design is essentially the vital component of a game that could potentially drive the game to stand out among other.</p>
        
        <p>“Design your character to stand out.” It can’t be stressed enough since a character is what define a game. We can argue many games do not have a well-defined character, for instance the Tetris. With only simple geometric shapes and gameplay objective, Tetris is in fact one of the most popular puzzle game that almost everyone in the world know. (Just a bias, no evidence) Tetris is an awesome game with one essential component of the game that is missing, and it is a character. Why is it important to have a character? Once again, use Tetris as an example. How would you describe a Tetris game? What type of story you can tell your friends about a Tetris game you have played a moment ago?</p>
        
        <p>Character design involve many interesting steps. Ultimately we want to create a fictional character that is memorable to our audience which is in this case, the players. The number one must do before designing a character for your game is to first define your audiences. If your audiences are children, your design might go better around the basic shapes with bright colors. You definitely want to do a little research and evaluation on what make a successful character. Secondly, consider the visual impact you could produce. Imagine you are to design a swordsman character who wields a giant blade with spiky blonde hair. Is that ringing a bell? What about Cloud Strife from Final Fantasy VII? Human can recognize these physical traits quickly and sometime, their judgment could lead to fault assumption or even discredit your work as a rip-off. It is a really difficult task to accomplish and to come up with an original character design every time; therefore, you must be careful with your approach to the uniqueness of your character design.</p>
        
        <p>Another character design concept is a character’s personality traits. Thinking of how your character would appeal to the audiences and what make your character unique. A few elements that especially important to make your character interesting is giving them a characteristic such as voice, and personality. It also includes the character’s appeals, which could be accessories, hair style, etc. On one of the important keynote is to take advantage of color. Some color schemes such as purple or black might be representing dangerous or evil while a pure white color depict a good being. Finally, a good background story of your character is the total killer. Tell a story about how your character come to be who he or she is and what type of goal or dream they want to achieve. Most audiences love this story telling and they will be curious to learn more about your character.</p>
        
        <p>To sum everything up, creating an impactful character for your video game to be memorable is very important as you want to create a successful game. They are the game’s mascot and the heroes.</p>
