        <h2>Color and Game Design</h2>
        <p>What are the stuff that really matter to you when you pick up a video game to play for the first time? There have been many occasions for me that I really have a strong desire to play a video game that its title is scheduled to release; and as soon as I got access to the game, the playtime for it is approximately less than an hour. There is a learning curve to a game’s mechanic itself, in fact it is a factor among many others that speculate my decision to give it a try and follow through. Regardless of how awesome the game may be, there is always a barrier that a newcomer to a game experience. My argument is, although all player have different background in gaming, color design is matter in game design. Therefore we will look at color in practice from multiple perspectives and how its integration enormously influence game design concepts</p>
        
        <p>Color serves creativity in a sense of visual interest. Its primary function is to help facilitate objects identification and in most cases, it is a tool for representation. For instance of the universal acceptance colors for traffic light agrees that green means safe to proceed, yellow means to be careful, while red is to stop. Another form of its utilities is it contains symbolic message or emotion that allow viewer to interpret quickly at a glance. In the context of video game, players perceive a friend to be blue and a foe to be red. Sometime game designers do not follow this concept which usually lead to all sort of confusion to player. On the similar note, color principle is applied to just about everything whether it is fashion or industrial design; and it is just as important in video game.</p>
        
        <h3>Color bring Emotion</h3>
        <p>Emotion play a huge role in video game. It simulates a natural instinctive state of mind, and mood that a player could experience. A well designed game take full advantages of utilizing color to achieve a richness experience of a game that it could offer. By using the right color palettes, it can invoke different kind of emotions and interesting effects. One same environment in a game scene could be colored, shading and lighting, to show players what time of day in the game or a flashback memory. There are many good examples out there which can also commonly find in fine art, photography, and film. Following the same aspect, color is strongly tied to association such that it could portrait to some form of special event such as Christmas, or Chinese New Year.</p>
        
        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>It is rather common to overlook this essential step in game design. Visual hierarchy demonstrate a cleverness of a game to attract player’s attention to follow what is important on screen. Carefully pick colors that balance well together establishes a good contrast between interactive objects versus other background objects. A bad example is an overly use saturated colors. In most cases it is pretty and attractive, but it also introduces a whole new challenge to players since everything that appear on the screen will surely compete for attention. It could potentially knock down the visual hierarchy of the main character.</p>
        
        <p>There are a lot more to talk under this topic including progression and exploiting colors as a game mechanics.We see how important color is applied in various applications; and many of which is extremely essential to further improve a game quality.</p>
